						<p><span>I</span> am a homeschool father of four residing in the St. Louis area 
							for over twenty years. I currently work as a geospatial engineer helping to 
							maintain and develop code to support geospatial web applications. I received my BS in Applied Geography with a Remote Sensing 
							Emphasis from Northen Arizona University, a MS in Geographic Information 
							Systems from University of Redlands, and a Data Science Certificate from the 
							Naval Postgraduate School. Some hobbies included ridding my 
							bike through the Mingo Wildlife Refuge. My wife and I like to 
							travel and as a family we recently completed a bus tour of Great Britian and 
							Ireland. I like to try to cook a variety of recipes from cookbooks from Chefs such as Bobby 
							Flay, Snoop Dog and Shaq. I do like to read, when I am not reading technical 
							books, I like murder mystery books set in the Victorian Era. My favorite book 
							of all time (not including the Bible), the Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor 
							Dostoevsky.</p>

						<h2 class="universal-h2 universal-h2-bckg">Geospatial Analyst</h2>
						<p><span>M</span>y interest in geospatial analysis began at Northern Arizona University where I studied remote sensing and geographic 
							information systems (GIS). School projects included using Satellite imagery and aerial 
							photography of geologic feature such as lava flows and faults near the Little Colorado 
							River. In addition, I studied pre-historic Native American sites, including the Sinagua 
							people group.  Imagery used in these studies included multi-spectral, hyper-spectral, 
							and synthetic aperture radar.  GIS and Remote Sensing software used included Erdas 
							Imagine and ESRI products such as ArcView and ArcInfo. After NAU, I spent 25 years 
							working as a geospatial analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) 
							using more ESRI products including the ESRI web API, ArcGIS Server & Engine, ArcGIS 
							online, and ArcGIS Pro. Through NGA, I received my MS in GIS with the University of 
							Redlands and presented my thesis project at the ESRI Users Conference in 2005.</p>

							national and commercial imagery to answer key intelligence questions 
							(KIQs). Job duties included using Remote View, SocetSet GXP, and ISPY 
							Electronic Light Table (ELT) software to review imagery and publish 
							official U.S. government reports and cables.  I worked issues 
							including wars in Afghanistan and the Ukraine, as well as natural

							I prefer to work in Python using Anaconda Jupyter Notebooks or the Google 
							Collaboratory Environments with such packages as Ptorch, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, 
							SciPy, Numpy, Pandas, and Geopandas. I am also proficient in R. I spent two years
